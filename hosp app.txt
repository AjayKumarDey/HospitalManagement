The Hospital Management App is a web application developed using Spring Boot and REST API technologies. The app is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing hospital operations such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and more.

The app's front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which provides an interactive user interface. The back-end is developed using Spring Boot, which allows for easy integration with various databases such as MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL. The app also uses RESTful APIs to provide a scalable and flexible interface for data exchange.

3. Billing and Payment: The app allows healthcare providers to generate invoices and bills for patients based on the services provided. Patients can view their bills and make payments online through the app.

4. Electronic Health Records (EHR): The app provides a centralized repository for patient health records. Healthcare providers can access and update patient records, view medical histories, and add new diagnoses or treatments.

5. Prescription Management: The app allows healthcare providers to generate electronic prescriptions for patients, which can be easily filled at any pharmacy.

Overall, the Hospital Management App is a comprehensive solution for managing hospital operations. It simplifies the patient registration process, improves appointment scheduling, and streamlines billing and payment.
